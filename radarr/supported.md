Thus supports a recent RSS feed AND backlog searching capabilities. The specification is not maintained nor supported by the Newznab organization. (The same API  specification is shared with nZEDb)
  - This is primarily only supported by [Prowlarr](/prowlarr) and [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett)
  - [Refer to the Settings Page](/radarr/settings#indexer-settings)

> Many torrent trackers thrive on the community and may have rules in place that mandate site visits, karma, votes, comments, etc.
> Please review your tracker rules and etiquette, keep your community alive.
> We're not responsible if your account is banned for disobeying rules or accruing Hit and Runs (HnRs)/low-ratio.

  - In the handful of situations where Plex is unable to watch the file system using ionotify - such as certain types of remote mounts and a handful of older network mounts - it is suggested to use the app plexautoscan rather than the Plex connection
- A use a tool like [plexautoscan](https://github.com/l3uddz/plex_autoscan) is another option.

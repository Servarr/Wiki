# Reverse Proxy Configuration

Sample config examples for configuring Radarr to be accessible from the outside world through a reverse proxy.

> These examples assumes the default port of `7878` and that you set a baseurl of `radarr`. It also assumes your web server i.e nginx and Radarr running on the same server accessible at `localhost` (127.0.0.1). If not, use the host IP address or hostname instead for the proxy pass directive.

## NGINX

Add the following configuration to `nginx.conf` located in the root of your Nginx configuration. The code block should be added inside the `server context`. [Full example of a typical Nginx configuration](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/)

> If you're using a non-standard http/https server port, make sure your Host header also includes it, i.e.: `proxy_set_header Host $host:$server_port` {.is-warning}

```nginx
location ^~ /radarr {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7878;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
}
# Allow the API External Access via NGINX
location ^~ /radarr/api {
    auth_basic off;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7878;
}
```

A better way to organize your configuration files for Nginx would be to store the configuration for each site in a separate file.
To achieve this it is required to modify `nginx.conf` and add `include subfolders-enabled/*.conf` in the `server` context. So it will look something like this.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name _;
  
  # more configuration
  
  include subfolders-enabled/*.conf
}
```

Adding this line will include all files that end with `.conf` to the Nginx configuration. Make a new directory called `subfolders-enabled` in the same folder as your `nginx.conf` file is located. In that folder create a file with a recognizable name that ends with .conf. Add the configuration from above from the file and restart or reload Nginx. You should be able to visit Radarr at `yourdomain.tld/radarr`. tld is short for [Top Level Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains)

### Subdomain

Alternatively you can use a subdomain for radarr. In this case you would visit `radarr.yourdomain.tld`. For this you would need to configure a `A record` or `CNAME record` in your DNS.
> Many free DNS providers do not support this {.is-warning}

By default Nginx includes the `sites-enabled` folder. You can check this in `nginx.conf`, if not you can add it using the [include directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#include). And really important, it has to be inside the `http context`. Now create a config file inside the sites-enabled folder and enter the following configuration.

> For this configuration it is recommended to set baseurl to '' (empty). This configuration assumes you are using the default `7878` and Radarr is accessible on the localhost (127.0.0.1). For this configuration the subdomain `radarr` is chosen (line 5). {.is-info}

> If you're using a non-standard http/https server port, make sure your Host header also includes it, i.e.: `proxy_set_header Host $host:$server_port` {.is-warning}

```nginx
server {
  listen      80;
  listen [::]:80;

  server_name radarr.*;

  location / {
    proxy_set_header   Host $host;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header   Connection $http_connection;

    proxy_redirect     off;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7878;
  }
}
```

Now restart Nginx and Radarr should be available at your selected subdomain.

## Apache

This should be added within an existing VirtualHost site. If you wish to use the root of a domain or subdomain, remove `radarr` from the `Location` block and simply use `/` as the location.

Note: Do not remove the baseurl from ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse if you want to use `/` as the location.

```none
<Location /radarr>
  ProxyPreserveHost on
    ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:7878/radarr connectiontimeout=5 timeout=300
    ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:7878/radarr
</Location>
```

`ProxyPreserveHost on` prevents apache2 from redirecting to localhost when using a reverse proxy.

Or for making an entire VirtualHost for Radarr:

```none
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:7878/radarr/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:7878/radarr/
```

If you implement any additional authentication through Apache, you should exclude the following paths:

- `/radarr/api/`

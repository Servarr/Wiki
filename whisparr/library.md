# Add New

![whisparr-add-new-empty.png](/assets/whisparr/whisparr-add-new-empty.png)

- If you're looking to add a new movie, this is the page that you will be wanting to do that from.
  - You'll find the how-to in our [Quick Start Guide](/whisparr/quick-start-guide).
- Below the search field, you can also find the Import Existing Movies button. If that is the case for you, you can find great information on that also in our [Quick Start Guide](/whisparr/quick-start-guide).
- If you get an error of "path is already configured", [see this FAQ entry](/whisparr/faq#path-is-already-configured-for-an-existing-movie).

# Library Import

Library Import allows you to import existing organized movies and each movie's file via existing files in the path directory. This is especially useful when making a new Whisparr instance and wanting to keep your existing movies.

- Library import is for adding and importing an existing organized library of movies into Whisparr.
- Library Import shall not be used for:
  - Importing files from a download folder
  - Adding or Importing one or more files that are not properly named and organized in their own Movie Folder within your root folder or a folder you wish to add as a root folder
  - Any other uses that are not adding a movie to Whisparr and importing the movie and its file from the root (library) folder that was input to Library Import
- If you get an error of "path is already configured", [see this FAQ entry](/whisparr/faq#path-is-already-configured-for-an-existing-movie).

> It is required that movie folders and files have the year in their name to be imported and parsed.{.is-warning}

> \* Non-Windows: If you're using an NFS mount ensure `nolock` is enabled.
> \* If you're using an SMB mount ensure `nobrl` is enabled.
{.is-warning}

> **The user and group you configured Whisparr to run as must have read & write access to this location.** {.is-info}

> Your download client downloads to a download folder and Whisparr imports it to your media folder (final destination) that your media server uses.
{.is-info}

> **Your download folder and media folder canâ€™t be the same location**
{.is-danger}

# Discover

Discover shows recommended Movies

- If you do not have list(s), it will show the top 90 most recommended movies based on the TMDb movies recommended for the movies in your library in addition to the 10 recommendations from your most recent additions.

> Tip: You can disable Whisparr recommended movies and view only movies from your lists in `Options`.{.is-info}

- If you have list(s), it will show the recommendations noted above AND entries from your list(s).

> Tip: Change the `Filter` to `New Non-Excluded` to only show movies that are not in your library.{.is-info}

- Chances are that your Discover recommendations will be sparse if you have a new installation with few or no movies. You will need to add library content to fuel recommendation direction. You have several options:
  1. Click on the [Add New Movie](/whisparr/library#add-new) button to add movies by hand.
  1. Click on the [Import Existing Library](/whisparr/library#library-import) button to import an existing library.
  1. Click on the [Add Lists](/whisparr/settings#lists) button to add a list to Whisparr. Additional information about lists can be found at the following page [supported](/whisparr/faq#what-are-lists-and-what-can-they-do-for-me).

![whisparr-discover-add-new-movies.png](/assets/whisparr/whisparr-discover-add-new-movies.png)

    1. Here you can select what movies you want to add to your library
    1. Here you can select all the movies that are on this list if you're feeling extra crazy
    1. Select what root path you'd like for these movies to go to once they are imported

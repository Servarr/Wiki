# Synology

- [The SynoCommunity creates, supports,and maintains a Synology NAS Package](https://synocommunity.com/package/sonarr)

> The NAS package is suboptimally maintained and occasionally out of date. If your NAS supports docker it is strongly recommended [to run docker](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/Synology/) instead. You will not be able to reinstall Sonarr without wiping your database manually due to the NAS package being out of date and not configured to update itself on startup. {.is-info}

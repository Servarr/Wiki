# Series

The series page shows your entire library and allows you to select individual series (however, searching can be more efficient in large libraries) and make searches for specific series, as well as being able to edit them. It also allows you to filter your series.

# Filters

The filters options allows you to narrow your series down and is incredibly helpful. It can be used to see release dates, names, episode counts, disk size counts, and too much more to list, including custom filters, to fit your every need. These can also be used in the mass editor.

# Add New

The add new feature allows you to add a new series for Sonarr to monitor and download.

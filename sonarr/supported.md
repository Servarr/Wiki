  - Newznab is a standardized API used by many usenet indexing sites. Many presets are available, but all require an API key to be accessible.
  - Indexer Applications like [Prowlarr](/prowlarr) and [NZBHydra2](https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2) can provide advanced capabilities such as stat tracking.
- omgwtfnzbs {#omgwtfnzbs}
  - A defunct legacy implementation of a private usenet indexer. Use Newznab instead.
  - [Refer to the Settings Page](/sonarr/settings#indexer-settings)

- Nyaa {#nyaa}
  - Torrent Tracker for Japanese Media (Anime) exclusively.

  - Known Issues exist with the native Sonarr version
    - [Nyaa seeders/leechers not parsed properly anymore. #4614](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/issues/4614)
      - This can be fixed when / if [Pull Request #4637](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/pull/4637) is merged
  - > Nyaa frowns upon automation and frequently will ban your IP. {.is-warning}
  - [Refer to the Settings Page](/sonarr/settings#indexer-settings)
- Rarbg {#rarbg}
  - Public Tracker
  - [Refer to the Settings Page](/sonarr/settings#indexer-settings)
- Torrent RSS Feed {#torrentrssindexer}

- TorrentLeech {#torrentleech}
  - Private Indexer
  - [Refer to the Settings Page](/sonarr/settings#indexer-settings)
- Torznab {#torznab}
  - Torznab is a wordplay on Torrent and Newznab. It uses the same structure and syntax as the Newznab API specification, but exposing torrent-specific attributes and .torrent files. Thus supports a recent RSS feed AND backlog searching capabilities. The specification is not maintained nor supported by the Newznab organization. (The same API  specification is shared with nZEDb)
  - This is primarily only supported by [Prowlarr](/prowlarr) and [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett)
  - [Refer to the Settings Page](/sonarr/settings#indexer-settings)

> Many torrent trackers thrive on the community and may have rules in place that mandate site visits, karma, votes, comments, etc.
> Please review your tracker rules and etiquette, keep your community alive.
> Weâ€™re not responsible if your account is banned for disobeying rules or accruing Hit and Runs (HnRs)/low-ratio.

# Notifications

{#notification}

- Custom Script {#customscript}
  - This allows you to make a custom script for when a particular action happens this script will run. See [Custom Scripts](/sonarr/custom-scripts) for more details.
- Discord {#discord}
  - By far one of the most common ways to push notifications of actions happening on your Sonarr
  - Supported field types:
  `Overview, Rating, Genres, Quality, Group, Size, Links, Release, Poster, Fanart, CustomFormats, CustomFormatScore, Indexer`
- Email {#email}
  - Simply send yourself or somebody you want to annoy with email. If you're using Gmail, you need to enable less secure apps. If you're using Gmail and have 2-factor authentication enabled you need to use an App Specific password.

> You can use a "pretty address" like `SomePrettyName <email@example.org>` {.is-info}

- Emby {#mediabrowser}
- Gotify {#gotify}
- Join {#join}
- Kodi {#xbmc}
  - Kodi spawned from the love of media. It is an entertainment hub that brings all your digital media together into a beautiful and user friendly package. It is 100% free and open source, very customizable and runs on a wide variety of devices. It is supported by a dedicated team of volunteers and a huge community. By adding Kodi as a connection you can update Kodi's library when a new episode has been added to Sonarr.
- Mailgun {#mailgun}

- Plex Media Server {#plexserver}
  - The server for your self hosted Plex system, Enabling this is much like Kodi will allow you to push an update to your plex server notifying it that a new/upgraded episode is available.
  - This is rarely needed and is only required if Plex is unable to watch the file system for changes.
  - In the handful of situations where Plex is unable to watch the file system using ionotify - such as certain types of remote mounts and a handful of older network mounts - it is suggested to use the app plexautoscan rather than the Plex connection

> Note that this may trigger a full library scan for the library/root folder the series is in.  It is strongly suggested to use the native Plex functionality that just watches the file system or to use a tool like [plexautoscan](https://github.com/l3uddz/plex_autoscan)

- Plex Watchlist {#pleximport}
  - Simply add a Plex watchlist for the authenticated Plex user to Radarr. Note that it's required that your list contain shows on it.
  - To have multiple user's watchlists you'll need to add each user's lists and authenticate with their Plex user.
- Trakt List {#traktlistimport}
  - Username - Ensure you enter the actual username of the user and not the user's name
  - List - Ensure you use the list name as presented in the list URL

    - Username: `some-user-name`
    - List: `trakt-list-name`

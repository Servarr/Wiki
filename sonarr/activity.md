## Blocklist

> Blocklist is formerly known as 'Blacklist' {.is-info}

The blocklist feature (accessible via selecting an "Unwanted" file, or one needing human attention, and deleting it, you are able to check the "Blocklist" box), allows you to tell Sonarr to no longer allow this release (not applicable to duplicate releases) and to search for a different one, that fits your filters (exactly like normally searching).

If you're looking to trigger a custom script, you can find more details here. Scripts are added to Sonarr via the [Connect Settings](/sonarr/settings#connections).

# Overview

Sonarr can execute a custom script when an episode is newly imported or renamed. Depending on the action, different parameters are supplied. Parameters are passed to the script through environment variables.

## Sonarr Logs

Note that the following will only be logged for custom scripts:

- Script `stdout` output will be logged as `Debug`
- Script `stderr` output will be logged as `Info`
- The trigger of the script will be logged in `Trace`

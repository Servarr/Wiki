Lidarr is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It
can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new albums from your favorite artists
and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename
them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of
existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes
available.

Thus supports a recent RSS feed AND backlog searching capabilities. The specification is not maintained nor supported by the Newznab organization. (The same API  specification is shared with nZEDb)
  - This is primarily only supported by [Prowlarr](/prowlarr) and [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett)

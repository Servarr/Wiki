# Wanted

## Missing

The wanted page displays missing albums with options to filter between monitored and unmonitored. Users can search for individual albums or query the entire list.

### Manual Import

The manual import button at the top of the Missing page is the best option for importing individual albums interactively from folders outside of Lidarr's root directory.

## Cutoff Unmet

The Cutoff Unmet page shows all releases that haven't been upgraded according to each release's Quality Profile settings. In simpler terms, these albums are generally lower quality files that Lidarr will try to upgrade.

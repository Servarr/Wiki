# Status

## Health

This page contains a list of health checks errors. These health checks are periodically performed performed by Lidarr and on certain events. The resulting warnings and errors are listed here to give advice on how to resolve them.

### System Warnings

#### Branch is not a valid release branch

The branch you have set is not a valid release branch. You will not receive updates. Please change to one of the [current release branches](/lidarr/faq#how-do-i-update-lidarr)

#### Update to .NET version

{#update-to-net-core-version}

- Newer versions of Lidarr are targeted for .NET6 or newer. We will no longer be providing legacy mono builds after 1.0 is released. You are running one of these legacy builds but your platform supports .NET.

##### Fixing Docker installs

- Re-pull your container

##### Fixing Standalone installs

- Back-Up your existing configuration before the next step.
- This should only happen on Linux hosts. Do not install .NET runtime or SDK from Microsoft.
- To remedy, download the correct build for your architecture and replace your existing binaries (application)
- In short you will need to delete your existing binaries (contents or folder of /opt/Lidarr) and replace with the contents of the .tar.gz you just downloaded.

> DO NOT JUST EXTRACT THE DOWNLOAD OVER THE TOP OF YOUR EXISTING BINARIES.
> YOU MUST DELETE THE OLD ONES FIRST.
{.is-warning}

- The below is a community developed script to remove your mono installation and replace it with the .NET installation. Contributions and corrections are welcome.
- This assumes you are on the `master` Lidarr branch update the variable if needed
- This assumes that Lidarr runs as the user `lidarr` update the variables if needed
- This assumes Lidarr is installed at `/opt/Lidarr` update the variables if needed

```bash
#!/bin/bash
## User Variables
installdir="/opt/Lidarr"
APPUSER="lidarr"
branch="master"
## /User Variables
app="lidarr"
ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture)
# Stop \*arr
sudo systemctl stop $app
# get arch
dlbase="https://$app.servarr.com/v1/update/$branch/updatefile?os=linux&runtime=netcore"
case "$ARCH" in
"amd64") DLURL="${dlbase}&arch=x64" ;;

    echo_error "Arch not supported"
    exit 1
    ;;

echo "Installation files downloaded and extracted"
echo "Moving existing installation"
sudo mv "$installdir/" "$installdir.old/"
echo "Installing..."
sudo mv "${app^}" "$installdir"
sudo chown $APPUSER:$APPUSER -R $installdir
sudo sed -i "s|ExecStart=/usr/bin/mono --debug /opt/${app^}/${app^}.exe|ExecStart=/opt/${app^}/${app^}|g" /etc/systemd/system/$app.service
sudo sed -i "s|ExecStart=/usr/bin/mono /opt/${app^}/${app^}.exe|ExecStart=/opt/${app^}/${app^}|g" /etc/systemd/system/$app.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
echo "App Installed"
sudo rm -rf "$installdir.old/"
rm -rf "${app^}.*.tar.gz"
sudo systemctl start $app
```

#### Currently installed mono version is old and unsupported

- Lidarr is written in .NET and requires Mono to run on very old ARM processors. Please note that Mono builds are no longer supported after v1.0
- Mono 5.20 is the absolute minimum for Lidarr.
- The upgrade procedure for Mono varies per platform.

#### Currently installed SQLite version is not supported

- Lidarr stores its data in an SQLite database. The SQLite3 library installed on your system is too old. Lidarr requires at least version 3.9.0. Note that Lidarr uses `libSQLite3.so` which may or may not be contained in a SQLite3 upgrade package.

#### New update is available

- Rejoice, the developers have released a new update. This generally means awesome new features and squashed piles of bugs (right?). Apparently you don’t have Auto-Updating enabled, so you’ll have to figure out how to update on your platform. Pressing the Install button on the `System => Updates` page is probably a good starting point.

> This warning will not appear if your current version is less than 14 days old
{.is-info}

#### Cannot install update because startup folder is not writable by the user

- This means Lidarr will be unable to update itself. You’ll have to update Lidarr manually or set the permissions on Lidarr’s Startup directory (the installation directory) to allow Lidarr to update itself.

#### Updating will not be possible to prevent deleting AppData on Update

- Lidarr detected that AppData folder for your Operating System is located inside the directory that contains the Lidarr binaries. Normally it would be `C:\ProgramData` for Windows and, `~/.config` for linux.

- Please look at `System => Info` to see the current AppData & Startup directories.
- This means Lidarr will be unable to update itself without risking data loss.
- If you’re on linux, you’ll probably have to change the home directory for the user that is running Lidarr and copy the current contents of the `~/.config/Lidarr` directory to preserve your database.

#### Branch is for a previous version

- The update branch setup in `Settings => General` is for a previous version of Lidarr, therefore the instance will not see correct update information in the `System => Updates` feed and may not receive new updates when released.

#### Could not connect to signalR

- signalR drives the dynamic UI updates, so if your browser cannot connect to signalR on your server you won’t see any real time updates in the UI.

- The most common occurrence of this is use of a reverse proxy or cloudflare
- Cloudflare needs websockets enabled.

##### NGINX

- Nginx requires the following addition to the location block for the app:

```none
 proxy_http_version 1.1;
 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
 proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
```

> Make sure you do not include `proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";` as suggested by the nginx documentation. THIS WILL NOT WORK
> See <https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/17081>
{.is-warning}

##### Apache

- For Apache2 reverse proxy, you need to enable the following modules: proxy, proxy_http, and proxy_wstunnel. Then, add this websocket tunnel directive to your vhost configuration:

```none
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]
RewriteRule /(.*) ws://127.0.0.1:8686/$1 [P,L]
```

##### Caddy

- For Caddy (V1) use this:
- Note: you will also need to add the websocket directive to your lidarr configuration

```none
 proxy /lidarr 127.0.0.1:8686 {
     websocket
     transparent
 }
```

#### Failed to resolve the IP Address for the Configured Proxy Host

- Review your proxy settings and ensure they are accurate
- Ensure your proxy is up, running, and accessible

#### Proxy Failed Test

- Your configured proxy failed to test successfully, review the HTTP error provided and/or check logs for more details.

#### System Time is off by more than 1 day

- System time is off by more than 1 day. Scheduled tasks may not run correctly until the time is corrected
- Review your system time and ensure it is synced to an authoritative time server and accurate

#### Mono Legacy TLS enabled

- Mono 4.x tls workaround still enabled, consider removing `MONO_TLS_PROVIDER=legacy` environment option

#### Mono and x86 builds are ending

- Mono and x86 builds will no longer be supported in the next build of the application. If you are receiving this error then you are running the mono version of the application or the x86 version. Unfortunately, due to increasing difficulting in development support for these legacy versions we will be discontinuing their support and thus releases for them going forward. Thus it is advised you upgrade to a supported Operating System that does not require neither x86 nor mono. You may also be able to explore using Docker for your needs.

#### FPcalc needs updating

{#fpcalc-upgrade}

- Lidarr useschromaprint audio fingerprinting to identify tracks. This depends on an external binary `fpcalc`, which is distributed with Lidarr v1 for Windows, Linux and macOS, but must be provided independently on freeBSD.
- Ensure the fpcalc binary bundled with Lidarr is executable (755 permissions). This would be found in Lidarr's installation directory (e.g.`/opt/Lidarr/fpcalc`) If it is not executable, then correct it's permissions with the below command and then restart Lidarr.
  - Note that for the fix `sudo` may be required or your path to Lidarr's binary folder may be different depending on your environment and setup.

```bash
chmod +x /opt/Lidarr/fpcalc
```

> The below information is for legacy v0.8.0 builds only.
{.is-info}

- To fix this on a native Linux instance, install the appropriate package using your package manager and make sure that fpcalc is on your PATH (this can be checked using which fpcalc and verifying that the correct location of fpcalc is returned):

| Distribution  |       Package        |
| :-----------: | :------------------: |
| Debian/Ubuntu | libchromaprint-tools |
| Fedora/CentOS |  chromaprint-tools   |
|     Arch      |     chromaprint      |
|   OpenSUSE    |  chromaprint-fpcalc  |
|   Synology    |     chromaprint      |

### Download Clients

#### No download client is available

- A properly configured and enabled download client is required for Lidarr to be able to download media. Since Lidarr supports different download clients, you should determine which best matches your requirements. If you already have a download client installed, you should configure Lidarr to use it and create a category. See `Settings=>Download Client`.

#### Unable to communicate with download client

- Lidarr was unable to communicate with the configured download client. Please verify the download client is operational and double-check the URL. This could also indicate an authentication error.
- This is typically due to improperly configured download client. Things you can typically check:
  - Your download client's IP Address - if it's all on the same bare metal machine, this is typically `127.0.0.1`
  - The Port number that your download client is using - these are filled out with the default port number but if you've changed it you will need to have the same one entered into Lidarr.
  - Ensure that SSL encryption is not turned on if you're using both your Lidarr instance and your download client on a local network (i.e., over plain HTTP). See the SSL FAQ entry for more information.

#### Download clients are unavailable due to failure

- One or more of your download clients is not responding to requests made by Lidarr. Therefore Lidarr has decided to temporarily stop querying the download client on it’s normal 1 minute cycle, which is normally used to track active downloads and import finished ones. However, Lidarr will continue to attempt to send downloads to the client, but will in all likeliness fail.
- You should inspect `System=>Logs` to see what the reason is for the failures.
- If you no longer use this download client, disable it in Lidarr to prevent the errors.

#### Enable Completed Download Handling

- Lidarr requires Completed Download Handling to be able to import files that were downloaded by the download client. It is recommended to enable Completed Download Handling. (Completed Download Handling is enabled by default for new users.)

#### Docker bad remote path mapping

- This error is typically associated with bad docker paths within either your download client or Lidarr

- An example of bad (inconsistent) paths would be:
  - Download client:  `/mnt/user/downloads:/downloads`
  - Lidarr:   `/mnt/user/downloads:/data`
- In this example the download client places its downloads into `/downloads` and tells Lidarr when its complete that the finished book is in `/downloads`. Lidarr then comes along and says "Okay, cool, let me check in `/downloads`." Well, inside Lidarr you did not allocate a `/downloads` path you allocated a `/data` path so it throws this error.
- The easiest fix for this is CONSISTENCY - if you use one scheme in your download client, use it across the board.

- Team Lidarr is a big fan of simply using /data.

  - Download client: `/mnt/user/data/downloads:/data/downloads`
  - Lidarr: `/mnt/user/data:/data`

- Now within the download client you can specify where in `/data` you'd like to place your downloads, now this varies depending on the client but you should be able to tell it "Yeah, download client, place my files into `/data/downloads/movies`" and since you used `/data` in Lidarr when the download client tells Lidarr it's done Lidarr will come along and say "Sweet, I have a `/data` and I also can see `/data/downloads/movies`, all is right in the world."
- There are many great write ups: our wiki [Docker Guide](/docker-guide) and TRaSH's [Hard links and Instant Moves (Atomic-Moves)](https://trash-guides.info/hardlinks/). Now these guides place heavy emphasis on Hard links and Atomic moves, but the general concept of containers and how path mapping works is the core of these discussions.
- If you're crossing operating systems or native and docker then you need a remote path map. See [TRaSH's Remote Path Guide for Radarr](https://trash-guides.info/Radarr/Radarr-remote-path-mapping/) and [Sonarr](https://trash-guides.info/Sonarr/sonarr-remote-path-mapping/) for more information.

#### Downloading into Root Folder

{#downloads-in-root-folder}

- Within the application, a root folder is defined as the configured media library folder. This is not the root folder of a mount. Your download client has an incomplete or complete (or is moving completed downloads) into your root (library) folder.
- This frequently causes issues - including data loss - and should not be done. To fix this change your download client so it is not placing downloads within your root folder. Note that 'placing' also includes if your download client category is set to your root folder or if NZBGet/SABnzbd have sort enabled and are sorting to your root folder.
- Please note that this check looks at all defined/configured root folders added not only root folders currently in use. In other words, the folder your download client downloads into or moves completed downloads to, should not be the same folder you have configured as your root/library/final media destination folder in the *arr application.
- Configured Root Folders (aka Library folders) can be found in [Settings => Media Management => Root Folders](/lidarr/settings/#root-folders)
- One example is if your downloads are going into `\data\downloads` then you have a root folder set as `\data\downloads`.
- It is suggested to use paths like `\data\media\` for your root folder/library and `\data\downloads\` for your downloads.
- Review our [Docker Guide](/docker-guide) and TRaSH's [Hard links and Instant Moves (Atomic-Moves) Guide](https://trash-guides.info/hardlinks/) for more information on the correct and optimal path setup. Note that the concepts apply for docker and non-docker

> Your download folder where your download client places the downloads and your root/library folder MUST be separate. \*Arr will import the file(s) from your download client's folder into your library. The download client should not move anything or download anything to your library.
{.is-warning}

#### Bad Download Client Settings

- The location your download client is downloading files to is causing problems. Check the logs for further information. This may be permissions or attempting to go from windows to linux or linux to windows without a remote path map.

#### Bad Remote Path Mapping

- The location your download client is downloading files to is causing problems. Check the logs for further information. This may be permissions or attempting to go from windows to linux or linux to windows without a remote path map. See [TRaSH's Remote Path Guide](https://trash-guides.info/Radarr/Radarr-remote-path-mapping/) for more information.

#### Permissions Error

- Lidarr (or the user lidarr is running as) cannot access the location your download client is downloading files to. This is typically a permission issue.

#### Remote File was removed part way through processing

- A file accessible via a remote path map appears to have been removed prior to processing completing.

#### Remote Path is Used and Import Failed

- Check your logs for more info. Refer to our [Troubleshooting Guides](/lidarr/troubleshooting).

### Completed/Failed Download Handling

#### Completed Download Handling is disabled

- Lidarr requires `Completed Download Handling` to be able to import files that were downloaded by the download client. It is recommended to enable `Completed Download Handling`. (It is enabled by default for new users.)

#### Download Client Removes Completed Downloads

{#download-client-removes-completed-downloads}

- It's required that your download client retain its history of completed downloads until Lidarr has imported them. If history retention is disabled then \*Arr may not see the completed download before it is removed from the download client. Your download client should be set to keep (usenet) and pause not remove (torrents) downloads after completion: **either indefinitely or for at least 14 days**.
  - Sabnzbd: Switches => Post Processing => Keep Jobs **must** be set to 14 days or greater OR be set to Keep All History
- Removing completed downloads from your client can be managed by Lidarr and enabled via the download client settings in \*Arr. Thus \*Arr can ensure that your download client history is cleaned up.

### Indexers

#### No indexers available with automatic search enabled, Lidarr will not provide any automatic search results

- Simply put you do not have any of your indexers set to allow automatic searches
- Go into `Settings => Indexers`, select an indexer you'd like to allow Automatic Searches and then click save.

#### No indexers available with RSS sync enabled, Lidarr will not grab new releases automatically

- Lidarr uses the RSS feed to pick up new releases as they come along. More info on that here
- To correct this issue go to `Settings => Indexers`, select an indexer you have and enable RSS Sync

#### No indexers are enabled

- Lidarr requires indexers to be able to discover new releases. Please read the wiki on instructions how to add indexers.

### Enabled indexers do not support searching

- None of the indexers you have enabled support searching. This means Lidarr will only be able to find new releases via the RSS feeds. But searching for movies (either Automatic Search or Manual Search) will never return any results. Obviously, the only way to remedy it is to add another indexer.

#### No indexers Available with Interactive Search Enabled

- None of the indexers you have enabled support interactive searching. This means the application will only be able to find new releases via the RSS feeds or an automatic search.

#### Indexers are unavailable due to failures

- Errors occurs while Lidarr tried to use one of your indexers. To limit retries, Lidarr will not use the indexer for an increasing amount of time (up to 24h).
- This mechanism is triggered if Lidarr was unable to get a response from the indexer (could be caused DNS, proxy/VPN connection, authentication, or an indexer issue), or unable to fetch the nzb/torrent file from the indexer.
- Please inspect the logs to determine what kind of error causes the problem.
- You can prevent the warning by disabling the affected indexer.
- Run the Test on the indexer to force Lidarr to recheck the indexer, please note that the Health Check warning will not always disappear immediately.

#### Jackett All Endpoint Used

- The Jackett `/all` endpoint is convenient, but that is its only benefit. Everything else is potential problems, so adding each tracker individually is now required.
- [Even Jackett's Devs says it should be avoided and should not be used.](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett#aggregate-indexers)
- Using the `/all` endpoint has no advantages, only disadvantages:
  - you lose control over indexer specific settings (categories, search modes, etc.)
  - mixing search modes (IMDB, query, etc.) might cause low-quality results
  - indexer specific categories (>= 100000) cannot be used.
  - slow indexers will slow down the overall result
  - total results are limited to 1000
  - if one of the trackers returns an error, \*Arr will disable it and now you will not get any results.

##### Solutions

- Add each tracker in Jackett manually as an indexer in \*Arr
- Check out [Prowlarr](/prowlarr) which can sync indexers to \*Arr and from the Lidarr/Radarr/Readarr development team.
- Check out [NZBHydra2](https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2) which can sync indexers to \*Arr. But do not use their single aggregate endpoint and use `multi` if sync will be used.

### Artist Folders

#### Missing Root Folder

- This error is typically identified if a Artist is looking for a root folder but that root folder is no longer available.
- This error may also be if a list is still pointed at a root folder but that root folder is no longer available.
- If you would like to remove this warning simply find the album that is still using the old root folder and edit it to the correct root folder.

- Easiest way to find the problem artist is to:

  - Go to the Artist (Library) Tab
  - Create a custom filter with the old root folder path
  - Select mass edit on the top bar and from the Root Paths drop down select the new root path that you want these artist to be moved to.
  - Next you will receive a pop-up that states Would you like to move the Artist folders to 'root path' ? This will also state This will also rename the Artist folder per the Artist folder format in settings. Simply select No if the you do not want Lidarr to move your files
  - Run the Check Health Task in System => Tasks

#### Lists are unavailable due to failures

- Typically this simply means that Lidarr is no longer able to communicate via API or via logging in to your chosen list provider. Your best bet if the problem persists is to contact them in order to rule them out, as their systems maybe overloaded from time to time.
- Review System => Events filtered for Warning (Warning & Errors) to see the historical failures or check logs for details.

  - Lidarr uses rolling log files limited to 1MB each. The current log file is always lidarr.txt, for the the other files lidarr.0.txt is the next newest (the higher the number the older it is) up to 51 log files total. This log file contains `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, and `info` entries.
  - When Debug log level is enabled, additional lidarr.debug.txt rolling log files will be present, up to 51 files. This log files contains `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, and `debug` entries. It usually covers a ~40h period.
  - When Trace log level is enabled, additional lidarr.trace.txt rolling log files will be present, up to 51 files. This log files contains `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace` entries. Due to trace verbosity it only covers a couple of hours at most.

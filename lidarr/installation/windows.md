# Windows

Lidarr is supported natively on Windows. Lidarr can be installed on Windows as Windows Service or system tray application.
> Windows versions are limited for support to those currently supported by Microsoft, others may work but this is an unsupported configuration
{.is-warning}

A Windows Service runs even when the user is not logged in, but special care must be taken since Windows Services [cannot access network drives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/services-and-redirected-drives) (X:\ mapped drives or \\\server\share UNC paths) without special configuration steps.

Additionally the Windows Service runs under the 'Local Service' account, by default this account **does not have permissions to access your user's home directory unless permissions have been assigned manually**. This is particularly relevant when using download clients that are configured to download to your home directory.

It's therefore advisable to install Lidarr as a system tray application if the user can remain logged in. The option to do so is provided during the installer.

> You may have to run once "As Administrator" after installing in tray mode, if you get an access error -- such as Access to the path `C:\ProgramData\Lidarr\config.xml` is denied -- or you use mapped network drives. This gives Lidarr the permissions it needs. You should not need to run As Administrator every time.

# How Do I Install Plugins

## Plugin Branch

Lidarr plug-ins allow users to extend the capability of Lidarr to include new indexers and download clients, including peer-to-peer networks and common streaming services.

Plug-in capabilities are currently only available on the `plugins` branch.

> You cannot go back to a mainline Lidarr branch (master/develop/nightly) without restoring a database prior to the `plugins` branch
{.is-danger}

### Native Installs -Windows, Mac, and Linux

- Navigate to `/settings/general` 
- Show Advanced if not already enabled
- Scroll down to Updates. Type in `plugins`
- Save changes.
- Update Lidarr

### Docker

Update your Docker Compose file to use the following image, pull, and recreate your Lidarr container. 

#### Hotio

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/hotio/lidarr:pr-plugins
```

#### LinuxServer.io

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/linuxserver-labs/prarr:lidarr-plugins
```

- Once you have changed branches, navigate to `/system/plugins`. You will have the option to enter the URL of the GitHub repository containing the plugin. Enter the URL and select Install. You can observe the progress in the lower left corner. The installation will take several seconds depending your installation. 
- If `/system/plugins` does not appear in the menu, ensure that `/system/updates` shows that plugins has a status of `Currently Installed`.

#### Manually Installing

> If the plugins branch is older than the current version of Lidarr you have installed, it won't automatically install via the updater. Instead, you will need to download the plugins branch and install file directly and install it over your Lidarr setup.

- See the [Installation Docs](/lidarr/installation/) and simply change the branch in the url noted in thr install docs from `master` to `plugins` otherwise following the docs as-is.

## Next Steps

- Install the plugin to Lidarr using the new Plugin Lidarr Page and the plugin's documentation.
- Restart Lidarr to complete plugin installation

[Deemix plugin by ta264](https://github.com/ta264/Lidarr.Plugin.Deemix)

This plugin enables Lidarr to search Deezer using Deemix. You must have a working Lidarr installation from the plugins branch, a working Deemix container, and an ARL from Deezer to use this plugin. In order to get FLAC files, your ARL would need to be for a hi-fi account type on Deezer.

- Enter the API key.
- Enter a '0' (Key) and your Soulseek username (Value) for 'Ignored Users'.
- Select the Test button.
  - The Indexer test will send a test search to slskd for "Silent Partner Chances".
- If the Test returns a green checkmark, select Save.

### Delay Profile

- Navigate to `settings/profiles` and scroll down to Delay Profiles
- Select the wrench icon on the right side of the profile you wish to use slskd with. Most installations will only have a Default profile.

# How to Contribute

We're always looking for people to help make Lidarr even better, there are a number of ways to contribute.

# Documentation

Setup guides, [FAQ](/lidarr/faq), the more information we have on the [wiki](https://wiki.servarr.com/lidarr) the better.

# Development

Lidarr is written in C# (backend) and JS (frontend). The backend is built on the .NET6 (and _soon_ .NET8) framework, while the frontend utilizes Reactjs.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Lidarr/Lidarr/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

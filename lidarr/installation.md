## Windows

Lidarr is supported natively on Windows. Lidarr can be installed on Windows as Windows Service or system tray application.
> Windows versions are limited for support to those currently supported by Microsoft, others may work but this is an unsupported configuration
{.is-warning}

A Windows Service runs even when the user is not logged in, but special care must be taken since Windows Services cannot access network drives (X:\ mapped drives or \\server\share UNC paths) without special configuration steps.

Additionally the Windows Service runs under the 'Local Service' account, by default this account **does not have permissions to access your user's home directory unless permissions have been assigned manually**. This is particularly relevant when using download clients that are configured to download to your home directory.

It's therefore advisable to install Lidarr as a system tray application if the user can remain logged in. The option to do so is provided during the installer.

> You may have to run once "As Administrator" after installing in tray mode, if you get an access error -- such as Access to the path `C:\ProgramData\Lidarr\config.xml is denied -- or you use mapped network drives. This gives Lidarr the permissions it needs. You should not need to run As Administrator every time.

## Linux

### Debian/Ubuntu

You'll need to install the binaries using the below commands.

> This will download Lidarr and install it into `/opt`
> Lidarr will run under the user `lidarr` and group `media`
> Lidarr's configuration files will be stored in `/var/lib/lidarr`
{.is-warning}

- Ensure you have the required prerequisite packages:

```shell
sudo apt install curl mediainfo sqlite3 libchromaprint-tools
```

> Warning: Ignoring the below prerequisites will result in a failed installation and non-functional application. {.is-warning}

> **Installation Prerequisites**
> The below instructions are based on the following prerequisites. Change the instructions as needed to suit your specific needs if necessary.
> \* The user `lidarr` is created
> \* The user `lidarr` is part of the group `media`
> \* Your download clients and media server run as and are a part of the group `media`
> \* Your paths used by your download clients and media server are accessible (read/write) to the group `media`
> \* You created the direcotry `/var/lib/lidarr` and ensured the user `lidarr` has read/write permissions
{.is-danger}

> By continuing below, you acknowledge that you have read and met the above requirements. {.is-warning}

- Download the correct binaries for your architecture.
  - You can determine your architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`
    - AMD64 use `arch=x64`
    - ARM use `arch=arm`
    - ARM and armh use `arch=arm`
    - ARM64 use `arch=arm64`

```shell
wget --content-disposition 'http://lidarr.servarr.com/v1/update/master/updatefile?os=linux&runtime=netcore&arch=x64'
```

- Uncompress the files:

```shell
tar -xvzf Lidarr*.linux*.tar.gz
```

- Move the files to `/opt/`

```shell
sudo mv Lidarr/ /opt
```

> This assumes you have created the user and will run as the user `lidarr` and group `media`.  You may change this to fit your usecase. It's important to choose these correctly to avoid permission issues with your media files. We suggest you keep at least the group name identical between your download client(s) and Lidarr.
{.is-danger}

- Ensure ownership of the binary directory.

```shell
sudo chown -R lidarr:lidarr /opt/Lidarr
```

- Configure systemd so Lidarr can autostart at boot.

> The below systemd creation script will use a data directory of `/var/lib/lidarr`. Ensure it exists or modify it as needed. For the default data directory of `/home/$USER/.config/Lidarr` simply remove the `-data` argument.  Note: that `$USER` is the User Lidarr runs as and is defined below.
{.is-danger}

```shell
cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/lidarr.service > /dev/null
[Unit]
Description=Lidarr Daemon
After=syslog.target network.target
[Service]
User=lidarr

TimeoutStopSec=20
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

- Reload systemd:

```shell
sudo systemctl -q daemon-reload
```

- Enable the Lidarr service:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable --now -q lidarr
```

- (Optional) Remove the tarball:

```shell
rm Lidarr*.linux*.tar.gz
```

## Docker

The Lidarr team does not offer an official Docker image. However, a number of third parties have created and maintain their own.

These instructions provide generic guidance that should apply to any Lidarr Docker image.

### Avoid Common Pitfalls

#### Volumes and Paths

There are two common problems with Docker volumes: Paths that differ between the Lidarr and download client container and paths that prevent fast moves and hard links.

The first is a problem because the download client will report a download's path as `/torrents/My.Music.2018/`, but in the Lidarr container that might be at `/downloads/My.Music.2018/`. The second is a performance issue and causes problems for seeding torrents. Both problems can be solved with well planned, consistent paths.

Most Docker images suggest paths like `/music` and `/downloads`. This causes slow moves and doesn't allow hard links because they are considered two different file systems inside the container. Some also recommend paths for the download client container that are different from the Lidarr container, like /torrents.

The best solution is to use a single, common volume inside the containers, such as /data. Your Movies would be in `/data/Movies`, torrents in `/data/downloads/torrents` and/or usenet downloads in `/data/downloads/usenet`.

If this advice is not followed, you may have to configure a Remote Path Mapping in the Lidarr web UI (Settings â€º Download Clients).

#### Ownership and Permissions

Permissions and ownership of files is one of the most common problems for Lidarr users, both inside and outside Docker. Most images have environment variables that can be used to override the default user, group and umask, you should decide this before setting up all of your containers. The recommendation is to use a common group for all related containers so that each container can use the shared group permissions to read and write files on the mounted volumes.
Keep in mind that Lidarr will need read and write to the download folders as well as the final folders.

> For a more detailed explanation of these issues, see [The Best Docker Setup and Docker Guide](/docker-guide) wiki article.

### Install Lidarr

To install and use these Docker images, you will need to keep the above in mind while following their documentation. There are many ways to manage Docker images and containers too, so installation and maintenance of them will depend on the route you choose.

## FreeBSD

{#freebsd}

This instructions work for FreeBSD 12.2 and jails in TrueNAS CORE (although in this case more work is required in order to setup the bind between folders, which is beyond the scope of this instructions)

- Create a user/group for Lidarr. I prefer to use just one user for all my \*arr apps, in order to avoid the "Permission War from Hell". As this is generally used in conjunction with Plex, here is my suggestion, but feel free to use "lidarr" or any other if you want. Just make things accordingly:

```bash
pw add group plex
pw add user plex
```

- Install the required packages:

```bash
pkg install mono6.8 curl mediainfo sqlite3 chromaprint
```

- Get the latest & greatest Lidarr version for Linux, but not the "-core" ones. Right now, while I'm writing, the latest version is "0.8.1.2135". Change things accordingly from now on if you got a different version number:

```bash

cd /root
fetch "https://github.com/Lidarr/Lidarr/releases/download/v0.8.1.2135/Lidarr.master.0.8.1.2135.linux.tar.gz"
```

- Create a folder in /usr/local/share with the name "Lidar-\<version\>". In our case:

```bash
mkir /usr/local/share/Lidarr-0.8.1.2135
```

- Uncompress the Lidarr package inside this new created folder, and change its permissions to the user/group "plex/plex":

```bash
tar xvfz /root/Lidarr.master.0.8.1.2135.linux.tar.gz -C /usr/local/share/Lidarr-0.8.1.2135
chown -R plex:plex /usr/local/share/Lidarr-0.8.1.2135
```

- Make a simbolic link to this folder:

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/share/Lidarr-0.8.1.2135/Lidarr /usr/local/share/lidarr
```

> This will make easier to switch back and forth versions if something went wrong with updates...
{.is-info}

- Create a file in "/usr/local/etc/rc.d" with the name "lidarr" and the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#
# Author: Michiel van Baak <michiel@vanbaak.eu>

# PROVIDE: lidarr
# REQUIRE: LOGIN
# KEYWORD: shutdown

# Add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf to enable lidarr:
# lidarr_enable="YES"

. /etc/rc.subr

name="lidarr"
rcvar=lidarr_enable

load_rc_config $name

: ${lidarr_enable="NO"}
: ${lidarr_user:="lidarr"}
: ${lidarr_data_dir:="/usr/local/lidarr"}

pidfile="${lidarr_data_dir}/lidarr.pid"
procname="/usr/local/bin/mono"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-f ${procname} /usr/local/share/lidarr/Lidarr.exe --nobrowser --data=${lidarr_data_dir}"
start_precmd=lidarr_precmd

lidarr_precmd()
{
        export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=${lidarr_data_dir}

        if [ ! -d ${lidarr_data_dir} ]; then
                install -d -o ${lidarr_user} ${lidarr_data_dir}
        fi
}

run_rc_command "$1"
```

- Enable the execution flags for this file:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/lidarr
```

- Now turn on the automatic execution of the Lidarr process and set the user under wich it will be ran:

```bash
sysrc lidarr_enable=YES
sysrc lidarr_user=plex
```

- Create the folder where the config files and data will be kept, and change the user/group of this folder so that the user "plex" can write on it:

```bash
mkdir /usr/local/lidarr
chown -R plex:plex /usr/local/lidarr
```

- Now, execute the following command to run Lidarr:

```bash
service start lidarr
```

- And check that it is really running and listening on port 8686:

```bash
$ service lidarr status
lidarr is running as pid 94896 # your number will be different...

$ netstat -an | grep -iw listen
tcp46      0      0 *.8686                 *.*                    LISTEN
```

Congratulations!

## Reverse Proxy Configuration

Sample config examples for configuring Lidarr to be accessible through a reverse proxy.

> These examples assumes the default port of `8686` and that you set a baseurl of `lidarr`. It also assumes your web server i.e nginx and Lidarr running on the same server accessible at `localhost`. If not, use the host IP address or a FDQN instead for the proxy pass.
{.is-info}

### NGINX

```none
location /lidarr {
  proxy_pass        http://127.0.0.1:8686/lidarr;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
  proxy_redirect off;

  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
}
  location /lidarr/api { auth_request off;
  proxy_pass       http://127.0.0.1:8686/lidarr/api;
}

  location /lidarr/Content { auth_request off;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8686/lidarr/Content;
 }
```

### Apache

This should be added within an existing VirtualHost site. If you wish to use the root of a domain or subdomain, remove `lidarr` from the `Location` block and simply use `/` as the location.

Note: Do not remove the baseurl from ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse if you want to use `/` as the location.

```none
<Location /lidarr>
  ProxyPreserveHost on
    ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:8686/lidarr connectiontimeout=5 timeout=300
    ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:8686/lidarr
</Location>
```

`ProxyPreserveHost on` prevents apache2 from redirecting to localhost when using a reverse proxy.

If you implement any additional authentication through Apache, you should exclude the following paths:

- `/lidarr/api/`
- `/lidarr/Content/`

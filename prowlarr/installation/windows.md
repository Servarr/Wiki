# Windows

Prowlarr is supported natively on Windows. Prowlarr can be installed on Windows as Windows Service or system tray application.
> Windows versions are limited for support to those currently supported by Microsoft, others may work but this is an unsupported configuration
{.is-warning}

A Windows Service runs even when the user is not logged in.
Otherwise, a system tray application can be used if the user can remain logged in. The option to do so is provided during the installer.

> You may have to run once "As Administrator" after installing if you get an access error such as Access to the path `C:\ProgramData\Prowlarr\config.xml` is denied. This gives Prowlarr the permissions it needs. You should not need to run As Administrator every time.

1. Download the latest version of Prowlarr for your architecture linked below.
1. Run the installer
1. Browse to <http://localhost:9696> to start using Prowlarr

- [Windows x64 Installer](https://prowlarr.servarr.com/v1/update/master/updatefile?os=windows&runtime=netcore&arch=x64&installer=true)
- [Windows x32 Installer](https://prowlarr.servarr.com/v1/update/master/updatefile?os=windows&runtime=netcore&arch=x86&installer=true)

> It is possible to install Prowlarr manually using the [x64 .zip download](https://prowlarr.servarr.com/v1/update/master/updatefile?os=windows&runtime=netcore&arch=x64). However in that case you must manually deal with dependencies, installation and permissions.

> If you use [Certify The Web](https://docs.certifytheweb.com/docs/backgroundservice/) for LetsEncrypt certificate management for IIS and are installing Prowlarr on the same machine, port `9696` is used by the background service. You will need to either change the listening port of Prowlarr in your `config.xml` to something else or change the port of the Certify The Web background service.

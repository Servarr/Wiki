# Cardigann Versions

- Below are the Prowlarr Cardigann  Versions

- For testing custom yml definitions please see [the custom yml section in the Indexer page](/prowlarr/indexers#adding-a-custom-yml-definition)

## Schemas

Each Cardigann Version has a YML Schema for it contained within the definitions's respective folder named `schema.json`
For more specific details between versions the schema files can be compared.

### Schema Validation

Schemas can be validated as follows. It is assumed the commands are ran from the local Prowlarr/Indexers repository directory.

> Note that the following npm packages are required `ajv-cli-servarr ajv-formats`  These can be installed globally on your system with `npm install -g ajv-cli-servarr ajv-formats`
{.is-info}

```bash
 ajv test -d "definitions/v{VERSION}/{INDEXER FILE NAME}.yml" -s "definitions/v{VERSION}/schema.json" --valid -c ajv-formats
 ```

# General

- Using definitions files it's possible to support many trackers or even indexers without having to write native C# code. All you need is a little knowledge about HTML and CSS selectors.

- Prowlarr Cardigann supports regular standard Cardigann scraping (HTML), parsing JSON responses, and parsing XML responses (exclusive to Prowlarr).

- In order to add support for a new Cardigann (YML) tracker or indexer submit a pull request on our [Indexer Repository](https://github.com/Prowlarr/indexers)

- You may test out your definition locally or create one for your own needs by using the [Custom Definition Folder](/prowlarr/indexers#adding-a-custom-yml-definition)

- The best way to get started is to look at existing definitions files. If you know a tracker which is similar to the one you want to add and is already supported just use it's definition as a base for your new definition file.

- Many sites often have a `Powered by` logo at a footer on their pages, and we try to tag our yaml indexers with a comment at the bottom to make finding similar engines a little easier. If you find a matching engine then you can use that indexer as a base for your new site, which will save you a lot of time and effort.
  - JSON definitions should be tagged as such
  - XML definitions should be tagged as such

# Format

- Cardigann YML is very strict about indentation. Ensure you maintain the 2 space indentation per level as shown in the examples here. Getting it wrong will lead to errors during a run, or perhaps worse, a silent ignore of the clause altogether!
- Text following a `#` (Hash) is a comment, and the ones in the examples below do not have to be included in your code.

## Header

Each definition must start with a header like this:

```yaml
---
# [REQUIRED] Internal name of the indexer, must be unique. Usually it's the name of the
# web site, in lower case, stripped of any special characters and space
id: thepiratebay
  
# [REQUIRED]  Display name (The full name of the tracker)
name: The Pirate Bay

# [REQUIRED] displayed in the tooltip on the add-indexer page and in the config panel
description: "Pirate Bay (TPB) is the galaxy’s most resilient Public BitTorrent site"

# [REQUIRED] Language code of the main language used on the tracker
# See http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm
# usually you load this with the value from the sites <html lang="en_US"> tag.
language: en-US

# [REQUIRED] Indexer type:
# public (no registration required)
# semi-private (registration required, but always open)
# private (registration required. Invite/application needed)
type: public

# [REQUIRED] Website encoding used by the tracker
# usually you get this from the sites html <meta charset=utf-8"> tag.
encoding: UTF-8

# [OPTIONAL] Can be true or false (default is false)
# Enable/Disable automatic update of the URL in case of a redirect to a different domain
followredirect: false

# [OPTIONAL] Can be true or false (default is true)
# Enable/Disable the pre-testing of the .torrent files when attempting a download (indexers
# that support fallback downloading need true). Some web sites do not allow performing two
# GET requests for the same .torrent in sequence so setting this to false will avoid an error.
testlinktorrent: false

# [OPTIONAL] The number of seconds in between requests to a site
# Mainly used for JSON API that limit the number of requests per period.
requestDelay: 2.5

# [REQUIRED] List of known domains
# (the first one is the default, must end with /)
links:
  - https://thepiratebay.org/
  - https://thepiratesbay.pw/
  - https://tproxy.pro/

# [OPTIONAL] List of old domains which no longer work
# If one of these URLs is configured it will be automatically replaced with the default one
legacylinks:
  - https://thepiratebay.sw/

# [OPTIONAL] If the tracker uses untrusted HTTPS certificates (self-signed, expired, etc)
# you can specify a list of SHA-1 Fingerprint (thumbprint) hashes which should be accepted
#  as valid anyway. This shouldn't be needed in most cases.
certificates:
  - D40789207A75EA36B02E255BF7162C8DF9637751
```

## Caps

Next, you've to specify the capabilities of the indexer.

```yaml
# Capabilities of the indexer:
# Mapping between the tracker categories and the Newznab categories.
# - id:      [REQUIRED] The tracker specific category ID.
#            Can be a string too.
# - cat:     [REQUIRED] The corresponding newznab predefined category - this must conform to the standard categories.
#            See this list for valid options
#            https://wiki.servarr.com/prowlarr/cardigann-yml-definition#categories
# - desc:    [OPTIONAL] The tracker category name.
#            If provided it will be used for a 1:1 mapping between
#            tracker and newznab categories.
# - default: [OPTIONAL] default flag, can be true or false (default is false)
#            Specify if this category should be used as default (if the search query doesn't
#            contain any categories).
caps:
  categorymappings:
    - { id: 101, cat: Audio, desc: "Music", default: false }
    - { id: 201, cat: Movies, desc: "Movies", default: false }
    - { id: 299, cat: Movies/Other, desc: "Video Other", default: false }
    - { id: 302, cat: PC/Mac, desc: "Mac", default: false }
    - { id: 901, cat: XXX, desc: "Porn SD", default: false }
    - { id: 902, cat: XXX, desc: "Porn HD", default: false }

  # Specify one or more torznab search modes and attributes that are supported by the indexer.
  # Implementation note: Prowlarr doesn't care very much about this, but you should still
  # specify the correct modes, as most apps calling Prowlarr via the Torznab API depend on them.
  # The q attribute is the absolute minimum default, and you should only add the others if
  # the tracker supports searching with them, especially imdbid, tvdbid, tmdbid and rid (TVRage).
  modes:
    search: [q]
    tv-search: [q, season, ep, imdbid, tvdbid, rid, tvmaze, traktid, doubanid, year, genre]
    movie-search: [q, imdbid, tmdbid, traktid, doubanid, year, genre]
    music-search: [q, album, artist, label, track, year, genre]
    book-search: [q, author, title, publisher, year, genre]
```

## Settings

Optionally you can specify which config options should be available for the indexer. If the settings block is not specified, the defaults are used (username and password).
Some examples:

```yaml
settings:
  # internal variable name
  - name: username
    # input type
    type: text
    # Display name
    label: Username

  - name: password
    type: password
    label: Password

  - name: pin
    type: text
    label: Pin

  - name: itorrents-links
    type: checkbox
    label: Add download links via itorrents.org
    # [OPTIONAL] set the following to true if you want the checkbox to be ticked. 
    # The checkbox is un-ticked by default
    default: false

  - name: info
    type: info
    label: ITorrents Note
    default: Without the itorrents option only magnet links will be provided.

  - name: category-id
    type: select
    label: Category
    default: 0_0
    options:
      0_0: "All categories"
      1_0: Movies
      1_1: Movies/HD

  - name: quality
    type: multi-select
    label: Select one or more quality
    options:
      480p: 480p
      720p: 720p
      1080p: 1080p
      2160p: 2160p
      4K: 4K
    defaults:
      - 1080p
      - 720p
```

If it's a public tracker and no config settings are needed then set `settings: []` to disable all options.

## Login

If the tracker requires a login, you've to include a login block. First, you've to pick one of the following login methods:

- post: The input values are transmitted as a HTTP POST request. This will work for many trackers which require only static login information (username, password, ...).
- get: Same as post but HTTP GET is used
- form: The input values are transmitted as a HTTP POST request. But instead of sending them directly, the specified path is retrieved first and the corresponding HTML form is extracted. This allows login to most trackers which require dynamic login information (e.g. CAPTCHAS or CSRF tokens). For google ReCaptchas no special configuration is required, they're detected automatically. In case the the tracker is using "simplecaptcha" (Messages like "click on the Bug" and "Click on the "X") it's automatically solved.
- cookie: the cookies provided via the `cookie` setting will be used.

After sending the actual login request the resulting HTML document is checked for error messages (`error` section). If one of the specified selectors matches the login is considered as failed and the matching text is returned as error message.

After checking for error messages, a login test is performed (`test` section). The specified path will be requested. If a redirect is returned the login is considered as failed. Optionally it's possible to specify a selector which must match for a successful login. Typically, the `path` is set to the same path as the torrent search path. Most trackers will redirect users to the login page if a login is required. If a tracker will just show the login form (no redirect) you'll have to specify a selector too.

### Simple POST Login

```yaml
login:
  # use simple post login
  method: post
  # target of the POST request
  path: takelogin.php
  # list of POST parameters
  inputs:
    # using configured username and password from the prior settings block
    username: "{{ .Config.username }}"
    password: "{{ .Config.password }}"
    # example of a fixed parameter
    keeplogged: 1
  # [OPTIONAL] error message handling
  error:
    - selector: #errormessage > span.warning
  # [OPTIONAL] using a simple redirect based login detection
  test:
    path: browse.php
```

### Complex POST Login

> Real world form logins won't need most of the options {.is-info}

```yaml
login:
  # Using a form-based login
  method: form
  # Location of the document containing the form
  path: login.php
  # location of the following POST request.
  # Only needed of it's not the same as the action specified in the form element.
  submitpath: takelogin.php
  # Selector for the HTML form element (default: form)
  form: form[action="takelogin.php"]
  captcha:
    # image based captcha (can be image or text)
    type: image
    # selector for the captcha HTML element
    selector: img[alt="Security code"]
    # name of the target form element (captcha value)
    input: code
  inputs: 
    # use configured username and password from the settings
    username: "{{ .Config.username }}"
    password: "{{ .Config.password }}"
    # example of a fixed parameter
    keeplogged: 1
  # [OPTIONAL] Only needed in case of dynamic input element names (very rare)
  # If it's set to true the keys/names from the 'input' section will be
  # interpreted as CSS selectors
  # example: https://github.com/Prowlarr/Indexers/blob/84349de6f7e2208caeab1d52d31169830dbbda01/definitions/v1/spiritofrevolution.yml
  selectors: false
  # [OPTIONAL] Only needed in very limited cases.
  # Can be used to include values based on a result of a selector.
  # e.g. if a CSRF token is hidden in JavaScript). 
  selectorinputs:
    # name of the required key-name,  for example: securitytoken
    securitytoken:
      # selector for the value
      selector: "script:contains(\"stKey: \")"
      # [OPTIONAL] further filters for the value
      filters:
        - name: regexp
          args: "stKey: \"(.+?)\","
  # additional arguments for the URL
  # Send as part of the query string, not in the POST body
  getselectorinputs:
    c:
      selector: "script:contains(\"login.php\")"
      filters:
        - name: regexp
          args: "login.php\\?c=(.*?)&rhash="
    rhash:
      text: 123
  # multiple selectors for errors
  error:
    - selector: tbody:has(td.colhead > span:contains("Error"))
    - selector: tbody:has(td.colhead > span:contains("failed"))
    # example of a complex error message handler
    # e.g. to deal with javascript based error messages
    # if this selector matches => login failed
    - selector: body[onLoad^="makeAlert('"]
      # [OPTIONAL] selector to change the error message which will be displayed.
      message:
        selector: body[onLoad^="makeAlert('"]
        attribute: onLoad
        filters:
          - name: replace
            args: ["makeAlert('Error' , '", ""]
          - name: replace
            args: ["');", ""]
  test:
    path: browse.php
    # [OPTIONAL] check this selector (must match)
    selector: a#logout
```

If the FORM or POST method does not work for the web site you can resort to using the cookie method,
which uses the session cookie when accessing the web site's pages

### COOKIE Login

```yaml
settings:
  - name: cookie
    type: text
    label: Cookie
  - name: info
    type: info
    label: How to get the Cookie
    default: "<ol><li>Login to this tracker with your browser<li>Open the <b>DevTools</b> panel by pressing <b>F12</b><li>Select the <b>Network</b> tab<li>Click on the <b>Doc</b> button (Chrome Browser) or <b>HTML</b> button (FireFox)<li>Refresh the page by pressing <b>F5</b><li>Click on the first row entry<li>Select the <b>Headers</b> tab on the Right panel<li>Find <b>'cookie:'</b> in the <b>Request Headers</b> section<li><b>Select</b> and <b>Copy</b> the whole cookie string <i>(everything after 'cookie: ')</i> and <b>Paste</b> here.</ol>"

login:
  method: cookie
  inputs:
    cookie: "{{ .Config.cookie }}"
  test:
    path: index.php
    selector: a[href="logout.php"]
```

## Search

The search block contains all the information on how to search and how to extract the necessary information from the various trackers.
There are three search method available, which are based on the response type from the web site.

- [Search HTML](#search-html) (Default)
- [Search JSON and XML](#search-json-and-xml)
  - It is also possible to search `XML` in Prowlarr with the JSON format

### Search HTML

It's possible to do some optional pre-processing of the search keywords first using the `keywordsfilters` list (e.g. to remove short search words or replace special characters with wildcards. After that the search URLs will be constructed based on the provided `paths` and `inputs`. All resulting paths will be requested. Each result is checked for error messages based on the `error` selector list. After that the rows are extracted based on the selector, etc. provided in the `rows` block. Finally, each row is parsed based on the `fields` list.

Example of a complex search block explaining all available options:

```yaml
search:
  # list of paths which should be searched
  # For the most trackers just a single path is needed. But some trackers use
  # different pages for e.g. porn or scene and non-scene releases.
  paths:
    - path: torrents.php
      # [OPTIONAL] HTTP method (get or post) (default is get)
      method: post
      # [OPTIONAL] Enable/Disable following of search redirects
      # can be true or false (default is false)
      # If you enable this make sure you specify a selector in the login/test section
      followredirect: false
      # [OPTIONAL] list of tracker categories
      # If specified the path will be only used if at least one category from the list is included in
      # the search categories list. A "!" as first entry negates the matching logic (include the path
      # in any other than the specified categories is in the search categories list)
      categories: ["!", 901, 902]
      # [OPTIONAL] list of (extra) arguments which should be added for this path

    description:
      selector: td:nth-child(2)
      # remove a and img elements to get rid of spurious text
      remove: a, img
```

Each field starts with the HTML row as value.
If the `text` keyword is specified the keys value is used. This can be used for fixed values (e.g. minimumratio and minimumseedtime).
If a fixed text value is not specified then the presence of the selector keyword is checked. If it's found then it's applied to the row. This allows you to extract more specific details such as the title or download link using CSS selectors.
After that the selector specified in the `remove` keyword is applied. With this, it's possible to remove unwanted elements (See the `description` example above). Any removed elements will be removed for good, they won't be available to following fields. Due to that you should put fields using the remove keyword at the end of the list.
Now it's possible to set the value based on the existence of elements using the `case` keyword. If the corresponding selector matches the field value is set to the specified case value. Processing ends after the first case selector matches. This is commonly used for `downloadvolumefactor` and `uploadvolumefactor`.
Finally, the resulting value will be processed by the template engine and filter engine (see below).

### Providing the category field with a default value

In the event that a field might not be reliably present from the site results, you can use the `default` statement, as shown in these examples:

```yaml
    category:
      selector: a[href^="browse.php?cat="]
      attribute: href
      optional: true
      default: 38
      filters:
        - name: querystring
          args: cat
    title_default:
      # this title may be abbreviated
      selector: a[href^="details.php?id="]
    title:
      # this title if present is full length
      selector: a[title][href^="details.php?id="]
      attribute: title
      optional: true
      default: "{{ .Result.title_default }}"
    seeders:
      # seeders may be missing
      selector: a[href$="toseeders=1"]
      optional: true
      default: 0
```

Note that the use of the `noappend` modifier is deprecated for the category field.
So if you have an old category block like

```yaml
    category:
      selector: td:nth-child(1)
      optional: true
      filters:
        - name: replace
          args: ["---", 4]
    category|noappend:
      selector: a[href^="browse.php?cat="]
      attribute: href
      optional: true
      filters:
        - name: querystring
          args: cat
```

then you will see warnings on your log, and you should convert to

```yaml
    category_default:
      selector: td:nth-child(1)
      optional: true
      filters:
        - name: replace
          args: ["---", 4]
    category:
      selector: a[href^="browse.php?cat="]
      attribute: href
      optional: true
      default: "{{ .Result.category_default }}"
      filters:
        - name: querystring
          args: cat
```

as at some point support for the category:noappend will be removed.

### Search JSON and XML

- This is supported for `XML` as well as `JSON` just by changing the response type

```yaml
search:
  # [OPTIONAL] extra headers which should be included in search requests
  headers:
    x-milkie-auth: ["{{ .Config.apikey }}"]

  paths:
    # [REQUIRED] If the API has different paths for some queries, you can use conditionals to define them
    - path: "{{ if .Keywords }}api/v2/torrent/search{{ else }}api/torrent/latest{{ end }}"
      # [OPTIONAL] The default is to send the query as a http get, the other choice is http post
      #            You can use conditionals to select the method for different path requirements 
      method: "{{ if .Keywords }}post{{ else }}get{{ end }}"
      # [REQUIRED] The response block is necessary to define parsing of a JSON response
      response:
        # [REQUIRED] "json" indicates that a JSON response is expected and "xml" indicates an XML response is expected.
        type: json
        # [OPTIONAL] In the event that a server does not return an empty JSON object or a Count set to 0
        # in response to a query-no-found state, you can code the exception here.
        # If the string you provide is contained in the response, or the server returns an empty response
        # and you coded an empty string here, then this will return the traditional "Found 0 releases" instead
        # of the default "Exception (indexer): Object reference not set to an instance of an object." error.
        noResultsMessage: "nothing found message from server"

  inputs:
    # Specify whichever query parameters the API is prepared to accept as valid. Some examples below.

    # [OPTIONAL] If there are multiple torrents per title
    multiple: true
    # [OPTIONAL] If the response contains a field that indicates the number of hits returned,
    # then you define that field in the count block selector, so that if the response had a

    count:
      # [REQUIRED] IF you have defined the Count block then you need to provide the field that has the count.
      # You can use the $ symbol to refer to a root object field, for example: $[0].id
      selector: data.movie_count

  # [REQUIRED] list of attributes which are extracted for each row
  fields:
    # All the regular filters are available as described elsewhere in the Wiki. I've included some examples.
    #
    # If you have not defined an attribute in the rows block above, then all the fields are extracted
    # from the rows set.
    # If you have defined an attribute in the rows block above, then a prefix of .. means that this field
    # is extracted directly from the rows set, and without a .. prefix you are indicating that the field is 
    # to be extracted from the attribute subset.
    #
    # Any fields below that do not have either [OPTIONAL] or [REQUIRED] are working fields.

    downloadvolumefactor:
      selector: freeleech
      # in this example the freeleech provided by the API is 0=false, 1=true
      # so we use a case block to provide the expected DLVF values
      case:
        0: 1 # not free
        1: 0 # freeleech
    # [OPTIONAL] Factor for the upload volume, in most cases it should be set to "1"
    # Set it to "0" for a torrent that is a neutral leech (upload is not counted), set to "2" for a double upload
    uploadvolumefactor:
      selector: double_upload
      # in this example the double_upload provided by the API is 0=false, 1=true
      # so we use a case block to provide the expected ULVF values
      case:
        0: 1 # normal
        1: 2 # double
    # [OPTIONAL] minimum ratio the torrent client must seed to avoid Hit & Run penalties
    minimumratio:
      text: 0.4
    # [OPTIONAL] minimum number of seconds the client must seed to release the MR requirement
    minimumseedtime:
      # 7 day (as seconds = 7 x 24 x 60 x 60)
      text: 604800
```

### Search Row Selectors

The use of `:has()`, `:not()` and `:contains()` are supported by the rows selector and fields selectors.

```yaml
 rows:
    selector: data:has(attributes.size):has(attributes.name:contains(1080)):has(attributes.poster:contains(.jpg)):not(attributes.fake_att):not(attributes.uploader:contains(DarkSwan2001))
  fields:
    title_dts:
      selector: name:contains(DTS)
      optional: true
      filters:
        - name: re_replace
          args: ["DTS", "DTSSS"]
    title_notdts:
      selector: name:not(:contains(DTS))
      optional: true
    title:
      text: "{{ if .Result.title_dts }}{{ .Result.title_dts }}{{ else }}{{ .Result.title_notdts }}{{ end }}"
      filters:
        - name: re_replace
          args: ["\\[", " "]
```

### Search XML

This is similar to the JSON method except you code type xml:

```plaintext
      response:
        # [REQUIRED] indicates that an XML response is expected
        type: xml
```

## Download

The download block is needed in the following cases:

- The torrent download link can't be extracted from the search results (e.g. if it's only available from the details page of the torrent)
- The download request must be done via HTTP POST instead of GET
- You've to access another page first before downloading the file (e.g. you've to click on the "Thank you" button first).

Note: Some trackers just omit the download link from the search results, but it still can be easily generated from the available information (e.g. use the details link and replace "details.php" with "download.php"). In this case the download block isn't needed.

Example of the download block explaining all options:

```yaml
download:
  # [OPTIONAL] use HTTP POST instead of GET to download the torrent file (default is get)
  method: post
  # [OPTIONAL] HTTP request which needs to be done before downloading the file
  before:
    # request target
    path: thanks.php
    # send via HTTP POST
    method: post
    # [OPTIONAL] if the before link requires a query separator other than the default "&" then use this
    queryseparator: ";"
    # list of HTTP arguments which will be included
    inputs:
      # extract the "id" parameter from the search result download URL query string
      infohash: "{{ .DownloadUri.Query.id }}"
      thanks: 1
  selectors:
    # [OPTIONAL] If a list of selectors is defined, the search result download URL will be retrieved and parsed as HTML.
    # The first selector is then applied to get the actual download URL.
    - selector: a[href^="download.php?id="]
      attribute: href
      # [OPTIONAL] Can be true of false (default is false)
      # Set to true if you want the selector to come from the page generated by the previous BEFORE block.
      # The default causes the selector to come from the page of the link in the search download block.
      usebeforeresponse: false
      # [OPTIONAL] a list of filters which should be applied to the result of this selector
      filters:
        - name: querystring
          args: url
        - name: urldecode
    # [OPTIONAL] As many other selectors as you need, to be used as a fallback for when the prior selector fails to download.
    - selector: a[href^="magnet:?xt="]
      attribute: href
      # [OPTIONAL] a list of filters which should be applied to the result of this selector
      filters:
        - name: toupper
```

### Download Block Infohash Example

```yaml
download:
  # [OPTIONAL] HTTP request which needs to be done before downloading the file
  before:
    path: get_srv_details.php
    inputs:
      action: 2
      id: "{{ .DownloadUri.Query.id }}"
  # [OPTIONAL] If you only have a magnet hash then this method will allow you to automatically generate a magnet URI
  # For use with Public or Semi-Private Indexers.
  # Note that this option is not suitable for Private sites which may require ONLY the use of their own tracker and 
  # have DHT DISABLED and no other PUBLIC trackers on the magnet.
  infohash:
    # [OPTIONAL] Can be true or false (default is false)
    # Set to true if you want the infohash and title to come from the page generated by the previous BEFORE block.
    # The default causes the infohash and title to come from the page of the link in the search download block.
    usebeforeresponse: true
    # [REQUIRED] Use this selector to provide the file hash for the &xt parameter of the magnet URI
    hash:
      # [REQUIRED] the selector to use to find the file hash
      selector: a[href^="magnet:?xt="]
      attribute: href
      # [OPTIONAL] a list of filters which should be applied to the result of this selector
      filters:
        - name: regexp
          args: ([A-F|a-f|0-9]{40})
    # [REQUIRED] Use this selector to provide the title for the &dn parameter of the magnet URI
    title:
      # [REQUIRED] The selector used to find the title
      selector: meta[property="og:title"]
      attribute: content
      # [OPTIONAL] a list of filters which should be applied to the result of this selector
      filters:
        - name: trim
        - name: validfilename
```

### Download Block "before" Pathselector Example

```yaml
download:
  # Use this method if you need to do a http GET using a href in the details page in order to make a download link available
  before:
    # thankyou link: ./viewtopic.php?f=52&p=65417&thanks=65417&to_id=54&from_id=3950
    pathselector:
      selector: ul.post-buttons li:nth-last-child(1) a
      attribute: href
  selectors:
    - selector: a[href^="magnet:?xt="]
      attribute: href
```

# Template Engine

The template engine is very basic, and supports the following statements.

## re_replace

A simple regex replace operation.

Syntax: `{{ re_replace .Variable "regex-term" "replace-term"}}`

Example:

```yaml
# Replace any non alphanumeric character in the keywords with the wildcard character
"{{ re_replace .Keywords \"[^a-zA-Z0-9]+\" \"*\" }}"
```

## if ... else ... end

A basic if/else condition. Only boolean true (non-empty)/false (empty) operations on variables are supported.

Syntax: `{{ if .Variable }}on true result{{ else }}on false result{{ end }}`

Example:

```yaml
search:
  paths:
    # when .Keywords contains a value
    # then search.php is used as for the path
    # otherwise latest.php is used
    - path: "{{ if .Keywords }}search.php{{ else }}latest.php{{ end }}"
```

## if or/and ... else ... end

The implementation is based on: [go hdr functions](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Functions)
These are not true logical OR and AND operators in that they operate on variables that contain a value or are empty.
Note that the use of round brackets is entirely optional.

Example of: if or ... else ... end

```yaml
search:
  paths:
    # when any of the 3 vars in brackets has a value 
    # then set the path to search 
    # otherwise set it to music
    - path: "{{ if or (.Query.Album) (.Query.Artist) (.Keywords) }}search{{ else }}music{{ end }}"
  inputs:
    # when either/both of the two query vars in the brackets have a value 
    # then load whichever vars have a value to the string 
    # and when neither var has a value then load the value from .Keywords to the string
    q: "{{ if or (.Query.Album) (.Query.Artist) }}{{ or (.Query.Album) (.Query.Artist) }}{{ else }}{{ .Keywords }}{{ end }}"
```

Example of: if and ... else ... end

```yaml
    title:
      # when both the vars in brackets have a value 
      # then load the value from title_polish to the string
      # when only one of the vars has a value, or both vars have no value
      # then load the value from title_phase1 to the string
      text: "{{ if and (.Config.lang) (.Result.is_polish) }}{{ .Result.title_polish }}{{ else }}{{ .Result.title_phase1 }}{{ end }}"
```

## if eq/ne ... else ... end

The implementation is based on: [go hdr functions](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Functions)
This is a string comparison only.
Supports the use of both variables and strings.

Example of: if eq ... else ... end

```yaml
    size:
      # when the variable .Result._cat contains the string "series"
      # then the text string will be set to "512 MB"
      # otherwise it will be set to "2 GB"
      text: "{{ if eq .Result._cat \"series\" }}512 MB{{ else }}2 GB{{ end }}"
```

Nesting is supported.

```yaml
    size:
      # when the variable .Result.cat contains any of the strings "movie", "movie_etc", "movie_eng"
      # then the text string will be set to "2 GB"
      # otherwise it will be set to "512 MB"
      text: "{{ if or (eq .Result.cat \"movie\") (or (eq .Result.cat \"movie_etc\") (eq .Result.cat \"movie_eng\")) }}2 GB{{ else }}512 MB{{ end }}"
```

Special variables .True and .False are available
.True contains "True" (which represents a non-empty variable) and
.False contains null (which represents an empty variable).

## join

A simple loop over a list variable building a concatenated string with items joined by a delimiter.

Syntax: `{{ join .Variable "<delimiter>"}}`

Example:

```yaml
# build a query string by concatenating all the categories with a comma
# input: [101,201,301]
"{{join .Categories \",\"}}"
# output: "101,201,301"
```

## range

A simple loop over a list variable building a concatenated string.

Syntax: `{{ range .Variable }}<prefix>{{.}}<suffix>{{end}}`

Example:

```yaml
# build a query string argument list for the selected categories
# input: [101,201,301]
"{{ range .Categories }}&cat{{.}}=1{{end}}"
# output: "&cat101=1&cat201=1&cat301=1"
```

## range (with indexing)

If a parameter requires indexing then use the following to generate an incremental index starting with zero.  

Syntax: `{{ range $i, $e := .Variable }}<prefix[{{$i}}]>{{.}}<suffix>{{end}}`

Example:

```none
# build a query string argument list for the selected categories with indexing
# input: [101,201,301]
"{{ range $i, $e := .Categories }}&categories[{{$i}}]={{.}}{{end}}"
# output: "&categories[0]=101&categories[1]=201&categories[2]=301"
```

## Variable substitution

The basic variable substitution operation.

Syntax: `{{ .Variable }}`

## Variables

TODO: more explanation

## Config Variables

Note that these are always available.
Generated based on the settings section

```yaml
.Config.$Name # for example .Config.username , .Config.password , .Config.sitelink
```

## Special Variables

Note that these are always available.

```yaml
.True contains "True" (which represents a non-empty variable)
.False contains null (which represents an empty variable)
.Today.Year contains "2022" (or whatever the current year is)
```

## Search Query Variables

Note that these are only available during search queries.

```yaml
.Query.Type
.Query.Q
.Query.Series      # not supported (Cardigann compatibility)
.Query.Ep
.Query.Season
.Query.Movie       # not supported (Cardigann compatibility)
.Query.Year
.Query.Limit
.Query.Offset
.Query.Extended
.Query.Categories
.Query.APIKey
.Query.TVDBID
.Query.TVRageID
.Query.IMDBID      # e.g. tt12345678
.Query.IMDBIDShort # e.g. 12345678
.Query.TMDBID
.Query.TVMazeID
.Query.TraktID
.Query.DoubanID
.Query.Album 
.Query.Artist
.Query.Label
.Query.Track
.Query.Episode     # EpisodeSearchString, such as S00E00 or S00 or yyyy.MM.dd
.Query.Author
.Query.Title
.Categories        # MappedCategories
.Query.Keywords    # original keywords
.Keywords          # keywords after applying the keywordsfilters
```

Note: There are several variables that are not supported are provided by Cardigann for compatibility with the Torznab specifications. These variables will always return null.

All field results are available to the following fields via the `.Result.$FieldName` variables too.
For example:

```yaml
  fields:
    title:
      selector: h3 a
    _subcat:
      selector: div.box ul li:first-child
    year:
      selector: div.box ul li:contains("Year:")
    _quality:
      selector: div.box ul li:contains("Quality:")
    description:
      text: "{{ .Result._subcat }} {{ .Result.year }} {{ .Result._quality }}"
```

Temporary variables used to help build release results should contain an underscore in their variable names, such as `title_phase1` or `_quality`.

## Download Variables

Based on the download search field result the following variables are available:

```yaml
.DownloadUri.AbsoluteUri        example: https://domain.to/torrent/1234567/A-Torrent-Name-1080p/
.DownloadUri.AbsolutePath       example: /torrent/1234567/A-Torrent-Name-1080p/
.DownloadUri.Scheme             example: https
.DownloadUri.Host               example: domain.to
.DownloadUri.Port               example: 443
.DownloadUri.PathAndQuery       example: /torrent/1234567/A-Torrent-Name-1080p/
.DownloadUri.Query              example: 
```

For each query string argument of the URI a corresponding `.DownloadUri.Query.$Key` variable is generated.
for example, a URI like `https://amigos-share.club/torrents-details.php?id=37346&hit=yes`
would generate the following two variables:
`.DownloadUri.Query.id` with the value `37346` and
`.DownloadUri.Query.hit` with the value `yes`.

# Filters

## querystring

Extract values from URL arguments.

Example:

```yaml
# extract the category ID from a category link
selector: a[href^="browse.php?cat="]
attribute: href
filters:
  # input: browse.php?cat=123
  - name: querystring
    args: cat
  # result: 123
```

## prepend

Inserts a *string* by appending additional characters to the beginning of its current value.
The single parameter in the argument is the *string* to be prefixed.

Example:

```yaml
# prefix InfoHash with a magnet URI header
selector: span > a
attribute: href
filters:
  # input: B21F2A6DB07A8F4F76E2C5E15D28235D356B8D41
  - name: prepend
    args: "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:"
  # result: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:B21F2A6DB07A8F4F76E2C5E15D28235D356B8D41
```

## append

Extends a *string* by appending additional characters to the end.
The single parameter in the argument is the *string* to be appended.

Example:

```yaml
# add a tracker to complete the magnet URI
selector: span > a
attribute: href
filters:
  # input: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:B21F2A6DB07A8F4F76E2C5E15D28235D356B8D41&dn=I.Am.A.Magnet
  - name: append
    args: "&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969"
  # result: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:B21F2A6DB07A8F4F76E2C5E15D28235D356B8D41&dn=I.Am.A.Magnet&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969
```

## tolower

Converts a *string* to lowercase letters.
Does not require any parameters.

Example:

```yaml
# make the title lowercase
selector: dt a
filters:
  # input: MY MOVIE TITLE 1080P
  - name: tolower
  # result: my movie title 1080p
```

## toupper

Converts a *string* to uppercase letters.
Does not require any parameters.

Example:

```yaml
# make the title uppercase
selector: dt a
filters:
  # input: my movie title 1080p
  - name: toupper
  # result: MY MOVIE TITLE 1080P
```

## replace

If the *pattern string* is matched, then the *pattern* is replaced by a *replacement string*.
The first parameter in the argument is the *pattern string*, and the second is the *replacement string*.

Example:

```yaml
# fix the date field when it contains Y-day
selector: td:nth-child(2)
filters:
  # input: Y-day 12:27
  - name: replace
    args: ["Y-day", "yesterday"]
  # result: yesterday 12:27
```

## split

Divides a *string* into an array of *substrings*, and return the selected *substring*.
The first parameter in the argument is the single character *pattern* used to split the *string*, and the second parameter is the array element *number* of the wanted *substring*, counting from zero for the first element.

Example:

```yaml
# extract the category id
selector:  td[class^="coll-1"] a[href^="sub/"]
attribute: href
filters:
  # input: sub/45/0
  - name: split
    args: ["/", 1]
  # result: 45
```

## trim

Removes all leading and trailing occurrences of a set of specified *characters*.
Used without an argument removes all leading and trailing *white-space characters*.
If a set of *characters* are supplied in an argument, then those will be removed from all leading and trailing occurrences.

Example:

```yaml
# fetch the title
selector: td:nth-child(2) a
attribute: title
filters:
  # input: &nbsp;This Is My Title&nbsp;
  - name: trim
  # result: This Is My Title
```

```yaml
# extract the title
selector: td:nth-child(2) a
attribute: title
filters:
  # input: xxxThis Is My Titlexxx
  - name: trim
    args: "x"
  # result: This Is My Title
```

## regexp

Perform pattern-matching and "search-and-replace" functions on a *string* using a [Regular Expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference).

Example:

```yaml
# extract the uploaded date and time
selector: td:nth-child(2) font.detDesc
filters:
  # input: Uploaded 09-14 02:31, Size 282.88 MiB, ULed by
  - name: regexp
    args: "Uploaded (.+?),"
  # result: 09-14 02:31
```

## re_replace

Similar to [replace](#replace), but the parameters in the argument are [Regular Expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference).

Example:

```yaml
# normalize to SXXEYY format
selector: td:nth-child(2) a.tab
attribute: href
filters:
  # input: 12x45
  - name: re_replace
    args: ["(\\d{2})x(\\d{2})", "S$1E$2"]
  # result: S12E45
```

## validate

Given a list of words, delimited by any one of `, /.)(;[]"|:` this filter will return a comma delimited list of only the words that
are in the args. Useful for removing non-genre types from an open tag list.

Note: to preserve a double word (for example `Science Fiction` or `Sci-Fi & Fantasy`) replace the spaces with underscores. These will be auto-restored in results.

Example:

```yaml
# remove any tags that are not standard genre types
selector: div.tags
filters:
  - name: re_replace
    args: ["(?i)(Science Fiction)", "Science_Fiction"]
  # input: crime, x264, 1080p, (music), pack, comedy, Science_Fiction, dd5.1, Hip/Hop
  - name: validate
    args: "Action, Adventure, Crime, Comedy, Science_Fiction, War"
  # result: crime, comedy, scence fiction
```

## dateparse

Converts a date/time *string* into a DateTime object ("ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z").
Requires two parameters in its argument, the first is the *string* to be processed into the DateTime, and the second is the *format* to use for the conversion.
For a full breakdown of the format specifiers see <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings>

## timeparse

Alias for [dateparse](#dateparse)

## timeago

Converts a time-ago *string* into a DateTime object ("ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z").
Does not require an argument.
Timeago can handle a time-ago *string* such as:

```none
now
2 hours and 1 day
4 years ago
1 week
5 months
9hr,12m,39s
8 days 3 hours 12 minutes 10 seconds
```

Example:

```yaml
# get the DateTime (assuming the current time is Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:17:24 GMT)
selector: td.torrent_table_dateAdded
filters:
  # input: 2 hours and 1 day
  - name: timeago
  # result: Sun, 17 Sep 2017 17:17:24 GMT
```

## reltime

Alias for [timeago](#dateparse)

## fuzzytime

Converts a fuzzy-time *string* into a DateTime object ("ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z").
By default fuzzytime renders a USA_Date. But if you supply an argument containing "UK" then it will return a UK_Date.
Fuzzytime can handle a fuzzy-time *string* such as:

```yaml
now
4 years ago (or any other timeago values)
Today
Yesterday
Tomorrow
1505788002 (a UNIX time-stamp Tue Sep 19 02:26:42 2017 UTC)
01-31 (dates without a year value)
1 Jan
Wednesday at 15:30
```

Example:

```yaml
# get the DateTime (assuming the current time is Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:17:24 GMT)
selector: td.torrent_table_dateAdded
filters:
  # input: Yesterday
  - name: fuzzytime
  # result: Sun, 17 Sep 2017 19:17:24 GMT
```

## htmldecode

Converts a *string* that has been HTML-encoded for HTTP transmission into a decoded *string*.

Example:

```yaml
# decode the HTML
selector: td:nth-child(2) a
attribute: href
filters:
  - name: querystring
    args: f
  # input: Anne+Rice%26%23039%3Bs+Mayfair+Witches+S01E01+1080p+WEB-DL+DD%2B+5.1+H.264-GGEZ
  - name: htmldecode
  # result: Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches S01E01 1080p WEB-DL DD+ 5.1 H.264-GGEZ
```

## urldecode

Converts a *string* that has been encoded for transmission in a URL into a decoded *string*.

Example:

```yaml
# decode the url
selector: td:nth-child(2) a.tab
attribute: href
filters:
  # input: https://zooqle.com/search?q=preacher+s01e10
  - name: urldecode
  # result: https://zooqle.com/search?q=preacher s01e10
```

## urlencode

Encodes a URL *string*.

Example:

```yaml
# encode the url
magfile:
  text: "{{ .Result.title }}"
  filters:
    # input: https://zooqle.com/search?q=preacher s01e10
    - name: urlencode
    # result: https://zooqle.com/search?q=preacher+s01e10
```

## validfilename

Ensures that a *string* comprises only characters that are valid for use in filenames.

Example:

```yaml
# get the filename
text: "{{ .Result.title }}"
filters:
  # input: aFile?Name>With<Invalid*Symbols
  - name: validfilename
  # result: aFileNameWithInvalidSymbols
```

## diacritics

Replace diacritics characters with their base character.

Example:

```yaml
# replace any diacritics
keywordsfilters:
  # input: ŠĐĆŽšđčćž
  - name: diacritics
    args: replace
  # result: SĐCZsđccz
```

## jsonjoinarray

Parse the input string as JSON, apply a JSONPath expression and join the resulting array using the specified separator.

args: [JSONPathExpression, separator]

Example:

```yaml
  # extract HTML code from a JSON response
  preprocessingfilters:
    - name: jsonjoinarray
      args: ["$.result", ""]
```

## hexdump

Dump the HTML of each row to the log in HEX format (for debugging purposes).
You will need to have *Enhanced Logging* enabled to view the results.

Example:

```yaml
date:
selector: div[class="resultdivbotton"] div[class="resulttime"] div[class="resultdivbottontime"]
filters:
  # input: Tue, 19 Sep 2017 21:21:52 +12
  - name: hexdump
  # result in the log: MM-dd hh:mm:ss Debug CardigannIndexer (trackername): strdump: T(54)u(75)e(65),(2C) (20)1(31)9(39) (20)S(53)e(65)p(70) (20)2(32)0(30)1(31)7(37) (20)2(32)1(31):(3A)2(32)1(31):(3A)5(35)2(32) (20)+(2B)1(31)2(32) 
```

## strdump

Dump the HTML of each row or field to the log (for debugging purposes).
You will need to have *Enhanced Logging* enabled to view the results.
If you are using strdump to debug multiple field selectors, you can use the Optional args so that you can uniquely tag the results in the enhanced log.

Example:

```yaml
selector: div[class="resultdivbotton"] div[id^="hideinfohash"]
filters:
  # input: dbbde2fc0c299c1d1aa43280b57dafc3fbf0bd39
  - name: strdump
  # result in the log: MM-dd hh:mm:ss Debug CardigannIndexer (trackername): strdump: dbbde2fc0c299c1d1aa43280b57dafc3fbf0bd39
```

```yaml
fields:
  title:
    selector: a[href*="?p=torrents&pid=10&action=details"]
    filters:
      # input: Star Trek 1080p
      - name: strdump
        args: title 
      # result in the log: # MM-dd hh:mm:ss Debug CardigannIndexer (trackername): strdump(title): Star Trek 1080p
  download:
    selector: a[href^="details.php/?id="]
    attribute: href
    filters:
      # input: http://tracker.btnext.com/details.php/?id=123456
      - name: strdump
        args: dl_href_in
      # result in the log: MM-dd hh:mm:ss Debug CardigannIndexer (trackername): strdump(dl_href_in): http://tracker.btnext.com/details.php/?id=123456
      - name: replace
        args: ["/details.php/", "/download.php/"]
      - name: strdump
        args: dl_href_out
      # result in the log: MM-dd hh:mm:ss Debug CardigannIndexer (trackername): strdump(dl_href_out): http://tracker.btnext.com/download.php/?id=123456
```

## Proposed changes

- Add support for a more powerful and cross platform template engine (JavaScript?)
- Add support for multi row parsing as described in <https://github.com/cardigann/cardigann/pull/336#issuecomment-277645749>

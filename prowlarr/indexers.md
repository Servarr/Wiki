This page will describe how to add and configure indexers in Prowlarr.

# Adding an Indexer

To add an indexer, first click on `Indexers` on the left, then <kb>+</kb> `Add Indexer` at the top of the page.

![ind_1_addindexer.png](/assets/prowlarr/ind_1_addindexer.png)

Choose your indexer from the list, or type a partial name in the box to find your indexer. If your indexer is not listed, you may be able to use "Generic Newznab" (for Usenet) or "Generic Torznab" (for torrents). Otherwise visit our [Indexer Request site](https://requests.prowlarr.com/).

> Using `Generic Newznab` or `Generic Torznab` assumes your indexer supports standardized *znab formats. If it doesn't, then this will not work
{.is-info}

> Note: almost every Usenet site is compatible with Generic Newznab.
{.is-warning}

> If your tracker or indexer is not listed and not on our [supported indexers](/prowlarr/supported-indexers) page, you can request it be added via our [Indexer Requests Site](https://requests.prowlarr.com)

# Editing an Indexer

To edit an indexer, first click on `Indexers` on the left, then click the wrench icon to the far right of the Indexer you wish to edit.

# Viewing an Indexer Id or URL

To view details about an indexer, first click on `Indexers` on the left, then click the Indexer Link in the Indexer Name Column. (Formerly the (i) icon to the right)

Details available may include:

- Id in Prowlarr
- Description
- Encoding
- Language
- Site
- Newznab/Torznab Prowlarr URL
- Site Capabilities

# Indexer Settings

Once you've selected your indexer, there will be a pop-up containing further information you will need to configure it. Note that the specific settings will change slightly for each indexer based on their required fields and the type of indexer you're configuring.

![ind_3_indexer2.png](/assets/prowlarr/ind_3_indexer2.png)

- Name - Select a name for this indexer. When it syncs to your apps, it will add `(Prowlarr)` behind it.
- Enable - Check the box to enable this indexer.
- Redirect - Check the box if a redirect is necessary. There are only a couple of indexers where this is required to avoid being banned. If enabled, this will pass the grab link directly to the application rather than proxying it via Prowlarr.

> Redirect is typically only needed for a handful of very specific indexers
{.is-info}

- Sync Profile - Select your Sync Profile here. These can be created in [`Settings` => `Apps`](/prowlarr/settings#applications). The Standard default, profile already exists, and looks like this:

> You can have different settings per app by creating multiple instances of the indexer
{.is-info}

![ind_3_settingsapps.png](/assets/prowlarr/ind_3_settingsapps.png)

- URL - Select the URL for Prowlarr to use. If blank, the default/first url is used.
- Download Link - If you're adding a torrent indexer, you may need to choose what kind of download link to use.
- (Advanced Option) API Path - Path to the Indexer's API. Typically `/api`
- Credentials - Many indexers and trackers require you to authenticate / login in some way. You may have to enter an API key, RSS key, a session id, a cookie, or other credentials from your indexer (usually found in your Profile Page or under Security), select search orders, or other options for your specific indexer.
  - API Key
  - RSS Key
  - Session ID
  - Cookie
  - Username/Password
  - etc.
- (Advanced Option) Additional Parameters - Additional parameters to add to the requests for this indexer.
- VIP Expiration - Enter the date in ISO format (yyyy-MM-DD) to be notified 1 week prior to expiration; otherwise leave blank
- Tags - Use tags to specify default download clients, specify Indexer Proxies, specify indexers to applications or just to organize your indexers.
- (Advanced Option) Query Limit - If your indexer limits your API hits per day, you can enter that number here to avoid exceeding the limit.
- (Advanced Option) Grab Limit - If your indexer limits your Grabs per day, you can enter that number here to avoid exceeding the limit. Once the grab limit is reached further queries will trigger an unhandled exception in \*Arr Apps. Other apps may very.
- (Advanced Option) Seed Ratio - For Torrent Indexers Only: The ratio a torrent should reach before stopping, empty is app's default
- (Advanced Option) Seed Time - For Torrent Indexers Only: The time a torrent should be seeded before stopping, empty is app's default. Values are in minutes.
- (Advanced Option) Indexer Priority - Priority of this indexer to prefer one indexer over another in release tiebreaker scenarios. 1 is highest priority and 50 is lowest priority. These priorities will sync to the \*Arr apps.

- Test your indexer, and if a green checkmark appears, you're okay to save it. When you save it, depending on your sync settings, it will be added to your apps automatically.

## Adding a custom YML definition

- Note that the yml definition is cached for a short period and if you make changes for development purposes you will need to wait out the cache or restart Prowlarr.
- If you wish to add a custom Cardigann compatible YML definition file for an indexer that is not supported or to test changes to an existing definition file:
  - Create (or if already created, navigate to) the Custom Indexer Definition folder named `Custom` within the `Definitions` folder of [Prowlarr's App Data folder](/prowlarr/appdata-directory)
    - Example paths:
      - Windows: `C:\ProgramData\Prowlarr\Definitions\Custom`
      - Linux: `/home/$USER/.config/Prowlarr/Definitions/Custom`
      - OSX: `/Users/$USER/.config/Prowlarr/Definitions/Custom`
      - Docker: `/config/Definitions/Custom`
  - Create your custom defintion '.yml'
  - Save your [Cardigann compatible YML file](/prowlarr/cardigann-yml-definition) within the custom definition folder and ensure Prowlarr has permissions to access it.

> The file name and id in the definition must be unique and cannot conflict with any other existing definitions.  It's strongly advised to have the name in the definition to be unique as well.

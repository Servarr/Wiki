This page will show you how to perform a search from within Prowlarr. In general, your searches would be via app, but it's possible to do them directly in Prowlarr as well.

## Performing a Search

To initiate a search, click on `Search` on the left menu. There will be a mostly blank page with some options at the bottom of the screen.

- Enter your search terms in the Query field.
- Choose your indexers in the Indexers drop-down.  You can check "Usenet" or "Torrents" to select all of the indexers in those categories automatically, or you can select specific indexers for your search from either group.
- Choose the categories you want to search on your indexers from the drop-down. You can select top-level categories (TV, Movies, etc.) to select all of the sub-categories automatically, or you can select specific categories from any of the groups.

Then click on `Search`. Your results may take a few seconds to appear. Once they do, you can add or remove columns using the `Options` button, and you can sort and filter your results by either clicking on the column headers or using the `Filter` button.

You can download the result by clicking on the download icon on the right of the result. This will send it to the proper download client you have configured.

> Anything downloaded will have the category assignment you've set in Prowlarr. This may require a manual import in your app program from a non-standard directory!
